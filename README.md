# Stone-Crush-Planet-Monitoring-System
We are designing an intelligent air pollution sensor for stone  crushers with a NUCLEO microcontroller.  It measures air quality, temperature, and light near the crusher  using sensors.  The information is transmitted to a computer via USART  communication, and live data can be viewed with PuTTY  software.
