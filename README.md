Stm 32 Using Stone Crush planet Monitoring System

Stone crushers emit fine dust particles into the atmosphere, causing 
environmental pollution and health risks. Exposure over long periods 
causes respiratory problems like asthma and silicosis, and damages crops 
by decreasing yields. Effective dust control is necessary to prevent these 
effects. 

Solution:

->We are designing an intelligent air pollution sensor for stone 
crushers with a NUCLEO microcontroller. 
->It measures air quality, temperature, and light near the crusher 
using sensors. 
->The information is transmitted to a computer via USART 
communication, and live data can be viewed with PuTTY 
software. 
->A buzzer will sound if the pollution exceeds safe levels, alerting 
individuals in the nearby. 
-> This system makes it easy to monitor pollution and ensures the 
surroundings and workers are safer.
